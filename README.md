## About The Project
This is the final project in IOS course, which is part of my academic stuides.
The project is a utility for commanders and soldiers for managing and collaborating tasks, 
where all users are allowed to perform operations that are transparent to all members of the group, through a convenient,
intuitive and simple interface.
